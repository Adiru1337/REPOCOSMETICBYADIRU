Death-Head Hopper lets you keep moving after death, literally.\
Hop around as your disembodied head and explore the dungeon, or bounce your way to your teammates to show them you’re very much... not alive.

## Features:
✅ Hop around as your head after dying.\
✅ Switch to spectate others anytime.\
✅ Includes tweaks to keep the gameplay balanced and fair.

*Updates coming, including shop upgrades.*

## Controls
While spectating, you can switch to your own head and control its movement.

**Jump (Space)** – Bounce into the air\
**Movement keys (WASD)** – Control jump direction\
**Tumble (Q)** – Reorient your head

## Notes

### Mod Requirements
The host must have this mod installed, and any players who want to use it must install it as well.\
For the full experience, all players should have the mod installed.

### Balance Tweaks
* To prevent self-revives, jumping is disabled once the last point is extracted (during the truck sequence).
* You also can't jump into the truck to prevent self-revives.
